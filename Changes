Revision history for Class-Method-Modifiers

1.05

1.04    Mon Jun 15 11:33:31 2009
        We need parens around confess if we're going to delay-load
            Carp, affects only 5.10 (reported by David Raab)

1.03    Sun Jun 14 14:44:25 2009
        Modernize the dist
        Fix possible test failures
        Only load Carp if we have to

1.02    Sun May 31 23:33:42 2009
        Fix for void context (reported by tokuhirom)
        Lift dependency on on MRO::Compat

1.01    Thu Jun 26 22:22:30 2008
        Revert the caching fix. It makes wrapping parent-class methods
            painfully slower.
        Remove the prototypes, newer Perls (rightly) warn about (@&)

1.00    Wed Jun 11 06:10:51 2008
        Complete reimplementation. Half the code. Faster than Moose.
        Remove 'guard' for now.
        *All* internals are changed.

0.07    Wed Sep 12 21:55:16 2007

        You may now modify a method in the same class as it is defined

        Can now use multiple modifiers of the same type in one class
        Should handle C3 MRO now

0.02    Sun Aug  5 16:42:43 2007
        No need to shallow-copy @_
        Don't stick a super method in UNIVERSAL (mst)
        Let multiple modifiers coexist in one class
        Better error checking
